The city council has declared the Ku   Klux Klan a terrorist group and condemned other hate groups as well  in a resolution approved after an emotional debate.``What goes on at Pastor Butler's property,'' he told the jurors, ``is really more akin to a homeless shelter for exceedingly politically incorrect misfits, malcontents, borderline derelicts and all manner of people that drift in and out.''Another reason the climate is better for pursuing these cases today, said Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., is that the FBI, which investigated some of the cases when they occurred, is more cooperative than it was 30 years ago.The public won't go along with it.The multimilliondollar award also represented the kind of message from the community that many civic leaders here had openly sought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called North Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist views.If that fails, he will appeal and may also seek to have the judgment amount reduced.Forget about lawyers.''........Butler's lawyer, Edgar Steele, argued throughout the sixday trial that however offensive jurors might find the views of Butler, he should not be held responsible for the actions of a group of drunken young men.Doubters figured Morris Dees was out to make a buck on their tragedy.The third former guard, Shane Wright, remains a fugitive.Morris S. Dees Jr., a founder of the center, hailed the jury's finding as a powerful message against racial intolerance and one that could force the group out of its 19acre property.``When we recruit, people know about Idaho potatoes and the Aryan nations,'' she said.But the larger purpose of the lawsuit was to bankrupt the Aryan Nations compound, limit Butler's ability to spread a gospel of racial hate and persuade the jury to ``return a verdict that will be heard all over this nation,'' a lawyer for the Keenans, Dees said in closing arguments.This month's edition is the Girlfriends issue, an ode to those faithful women who help us through our lives, those who are the Marys to our Rhodas, the Lavernes to our Shirleys.
