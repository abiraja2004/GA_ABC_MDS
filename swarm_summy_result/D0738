Thousands of miners flooded into the Imataca rain forest in the 1980s.Government officials say the power line is to run mainly alongside highways already built in the region and will cause little environmental damage.  LIMA, May 11   A rich gold seam with estimated reserves of 16.8 million metric tons of mineral ore has been discovered in South America's biggest gold mine in Peru.Peru sold a total of 641.6 million dollars of gold during the first 10 months of the year,compared with 412.2 million dollars in the same period of 1997.Investments in the economic sector stood at 35.6 percent in communications, 17.4 percent in mining, 5.1 percent in energy and 13.2 percent for industry while 10.6 percent went to the financial sector and 4.7 percent to commerce.  LIMA, December 19   Peru's gold output this year is expected to grow by 20.5 percent from last year to 92.6 tons, keeping Peru the eighth biggest gold manufacturing country in the world.In Imataca they built a frontier town called Las Claritas on top of what is believed to be the richest gold deposit in Latin America.Chavez, a former coup leader who took office in February,   promised during his campaign to reverse a 1997 decree that  legalized gold and diamond mining in the pristine Imataca rain  forest in southeast Venezuela.The increase in gold output is a result of the effort of entrepreneurs and workers as well as the confidence of national and foreign investors, said Jaime Uranga, chairman of the National Mining, Oil, and Energy Society's Gold Committee.It said the increasing momentum would become more accentuated in the next three years.Gold production in 1995 stood at between 53 and 55 tons, and gold export amounted to 600 million dollars last year.
