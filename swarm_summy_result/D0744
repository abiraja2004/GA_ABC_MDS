Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman said he hoped Thursday's announcement would also help the meat industry, particularly hog farmers who have seen prices for pork as low as 9 cents a pound.The sales volume of last year was about 28.5 billion yuan .Californiabased Petaluma Poultry, which has marketed   antibioticfree chicken for several years, plans to introduce its  Rosie the Organic Chicken next week to consumers in California,  Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.Stossel will make the correction.Organic food has become an area of vigorous development in China's agriculture and food production.Last year, when the Agriculture Department proposed national standards for organic food that included genetically altered food, more than 200,000 comments were received protesting the proposed regulations.For instance, fruits and vegetables shouldn't have pesticides,   herbicides or preservatives.Congress ordered national organic standards in 1990.In the report, the correspondent John Stossel said research commissioned by ABC News showed that conventional produce did not necessarily have more pesticide residue than did organic produce.Problems with the report were first brought to light by the members of the Environmental Working Group, which supports the consumption of organic food.Once a small minority, now there are more than 10,000 U.S. farms   trying to raise organic crops and livestock, the Organic Farming  Research Foundation said.When a label says ``grown and processed in accordance with the   California Organic Foods Act of 1990,'' it does not necessarily  mean the food is truly organic, according to the organic foods  industry, farmers, inspectors and others.The rules are expected to:      require that farmers go through a mandatory planning process and have their practices certified by an approved state or private agency.None of the mainstream supermarkets has matched the certifiedorganic and allnatural inventory found at specialty stores such as Austinbased Whole Foods Markets, the nation's No.The department is developing the first national standards on   organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and  industry guidelines.
