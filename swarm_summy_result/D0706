The official said the refugees had no connection to the Burmese guerrilla group that stormed a Thai hospital this week.But such occurrences in Burma on a vast scale have received little attention, in part because the rapes have been perpetrated in inaccessible areas.    BANGKOK, Thailand  _ On the tenth anniversary of the military takeover in Myanmar, about 60 exiled dissidents protested in front of their country's embassy in Bangkok on Friday calling for the release of political prisoners and arrested students.``In response to recent media speculation, the British government would like to make clear that Aung San Suu Kyi is not, and never has been, a British citizen,'' a statement from the embassy said on Friday.     BANGKOK, Thailand _ The 10th anniversary of a crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators passed quietly Saturday in Myanmar without the violence many had feared, but also without any sign of a resolution of the country's deepening problems.It is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the success of our policy toward China or Burma.Leading generals have also recently stepped up their verbal attacks against 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is married to a British academic, calling her a traitor for her attempts to bring democracy to the country.So we need a really widespread AIDS education program.``We are calling on the military dictators to release all political prisoners, which include elected members of parliament, students, many of whom were recently arrested,'' said Angelay, the spokesman for the All Burma Students Democratic Front.Since Sunday, the military has arrested more than 300 of members of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, to prevent it from convening the parliament elected in 1990.The Foreign Office announced Tuesday that the military regime in Rangoon said no minister or officials will receive a visa to enter the country, also known as Burma.  YANGON, January 15   At least 20 more members of various antigovernment armed groups in Myanmar surrendered to the government last month, the Mirror newspaper reported Thursday.
