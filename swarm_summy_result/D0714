On May 3, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich handdelivered 13 cardboard boxes filled with the screen names of more than 335,000 Napster users the band said claims   were offering illegal copies of Metallica songs during the last weekend of April.As he put it, ``I was partying all the time.Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement, the battle had been waged primarily by the music companies' trade group, the Recording Industry Association of America.``This is the most egregious case of mass copyright infringement that has ever existed,'' Frackman said.It might be a little harder, but people will still find ways to do it,'' he said.Still, the pending copyright infringement lawsuits Metallica and Dr. Dre filed against the San Mateo, Calif., startup in April named three colleges as defendants and left room for others to be added.     SAN FRANCISCO _ In a major victory for the recording industry, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels.The Recording Industry Association of America accuses them of copyright infringement and has tried to shut them down or curtail their use of popular material.``Nah, ya think?''MORE..Internet message boards were filled with posts from banned users who got back online simply by deleting Napster and any references to Metallica on their hard drives.Congress and the courts need to refine copyright protection in a way that benefits consumers as well as giant industries.     SAN FRANCISCO _ The lawyer representing Metallica and Dr. Dre in lawsuits against Napster Inc. has asked Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and more than twodozen other colleges to ``promptly ban'' the popular file sharing program.The San Mateo, Calif., startup plans to expand its workforce and office space now that it has closed a $15 million round of venture funding led by noted San Francisco investment firm Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, along with money from Angel Investors LP.Barry argued that Internet distribution ``is helping, not hurting'' the music industry by allowing people to sample music before buying it, leading to more store sales.Other Napster users then can listen to or download music kept on others' computers.The group released a statement saying the alleged violations of its music were logged by a computer consulting firm, NetPD.
