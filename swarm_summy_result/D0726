     WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore emerges from President Clinton's impeachment struggle with his own presidential campaign strengthened by the disciplined Democratic unity that helped rescue the embattled chief executive.Klain was criticized by some Gore allies after President Clinton called a reporter for The New York Times in May and said Gore needed to loosen up on the campaign trail.     WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, accepting endorsements from hundreds of Latino leaders, warned Tuesday that Republicansponsored tax cuts, the GOP's opposition to census sampling and Texas Gov.The same study found Mrs. Dole beating Gore 50 percent to 42 percent.Among the members of the California Democratic congressional delegation who announced their formal endorsements of Gore's presidential campaign Wednesday were Lois Capps of Santa Barbara, Gary Condit of Modesto, Julian Dixon of Los Angeles, Bob Filner of Chula Vista, Tom Lantos of San Mateo, Barbara Lee of Oakland, Bob Matsui of Sacramento, Ellen Tauscher of Walnut Creek and Mike Thompson of Napa.Catherine ``Kiki'' Moore, who worked for the 1992 and 1996   ClintonGore campaigns, will fill the empty press secretary slot at  Gore 2000 starting Sept. 7, campaign general chairman Tony Coelho  said.  WASHINGTON   Vice President Al Gore said Sunday his   campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, is ``doing a great job'' and will  stay on despite a government report that found questionable  financial management while Coelho directed the U.S. pavilion at the  1998 world's fair in Portugal.But the vice president's campaign for the White House faces a fresh challenge from some Democrats in Congress who want Gore to criticize the president's conduct to help the party distinguish itself more effectively from Clinton on the hotbutton issue of personal values.``We've got to have a nominee who can win,'' Bradley said.Bradley was endorsed by local environmental leaders as a champion of Pacific Northwest concerns such as pipeline safety, salmon restoration and prevention of oil tanker spills.
