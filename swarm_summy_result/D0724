More than half of all adults in the United States _ 54.9 percent _ are now overweight or obese, according to research being published today by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.And these experts say the pathway to a truly effective obesity drug is being illuminated by the very hormone, leptin, that has proved so disappointing.The results were adjusted for age, education,  physical activity, alcohol use, marital status, use of aspirin as a  bloodthinner, consumption of fats and vegetables, and use of  estrogen supplements.``In developing a drug, it is always easier to decrease gene function rather than to try to increase it,      The discovery of genes like mahogany stir excitement in the obesity research field.The figures released by the federal agency in Atlanta show that 17.9 percent of Americans are obese.Last year, the National Institutes of Health set the standard for overweight lower _ in effect, reclassifying as overweight an additional 29 million Americans.The researchers reported that moderate weight loss would substantially reduce the expected number of years of life that people would have hypertension, type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.He picked out frosted flakes.``The absolute risk of dying gets higher and higher as you get   older until you die, but the importance of obesity as a risk factor  decreases,'' said Ralf Bender, an obesity researcher at the  University of Bielefeld in Germany and principal author of the  study published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical  Association.New research on the biological basis of obesity and the urgency of the epidemic have changed their perspective, he said.The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into obesity than ever, especially in light of another group of findings linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems, including heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and even some forms of cancer.Hill, director of the Colorado Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at the University of Colorado, puts a preponderance of blame for fat Americans on our culture: Americans have too much food available; social and work situations encourage overeating; restaurants compete by offering bigger and bigger servings; 64ounce Big Gulps and Thirst Busters have replaced 12ounce bottled soda; and technology has made it possible to avoid exercise.``We're also aware that the proportion of Georgians who get no regular physical activity has been increasing every year, probably 2 percent every year for the past 15 years.
