Simpson lost a civil lawsuit over the deaths of his wife, Nicole, and her friend Ron Goldman in 1997.Simpson has lost a bid to block broadcast of a TV miniseries he claims would reveal his defense team secrets to an audience of millions.Lawyers for Simpson also declined comment.But the author's lawyers pointed out that no one took legal action until the miniseries was nearly completed.``If   any of them had the money to properly defend themselves, maybe they  wouldn't have had to spend any time in jail.''In the civil trial, Simpson was held liable for the 1994 deaths   of Ms. Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman and was ordered to pay  $33.5 million in damages.Judge David Yaffe declined to issue a restraining order that would have immediately barred Schiller from working on the miniseries, but scheduled a hearing Sept. 6 on a request for a preliminary injunction that would accomplish the same purpose.In February 1997, a civil jury found Simpson liable for the stabbing deaths of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson.''It's about the defense team and the quite amazing ego challenges involved,'' he said.     LOS ANGELES   O.J.The auction raised $430,000 to help pay off the $33.5 million a   jury ordered Simpson to pay when it held him liable for the  slayings of his exwife and her friend Ron Goldman.Although Simpson was acquitted of murder during a criminal trial, he was found liable for the killings in a wrongful death trial that ended earlier this year.The guiding hand behind the production is Lawrence Schiller, who wrote the book ''American Tragedy'' with James Willwerth based on information from his ''mole'' on the defense team, lawyer Robert Kardashian.Entertainment Television's second original TV movie, takes a comic look at a struggling actor who discovers a formula for success  being a heel  and then learns success isn't all it's cracked up to be.The challenges of playing Bailey included a physical transformation for Plummer, whose body was padded and his face altered by a rubber mask.Unlike the online process that took place recently for Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball _ the highest bid was used as a starting point for the real bidding done at a Chicago auction house _ this will go along in real time, allowing those who just want to sit and watch do so.
