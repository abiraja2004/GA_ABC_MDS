PARIS, July 4   France has raised its unemployment benefits by 2.45 percent as of July 1, announced Denis GautierSauvagnac, president of the unemployment insurance regime of UNEDIC.Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems.Sixtytwo percent of people say that to have five million poor people in France is something unacceptable, while 20 percent say that they feel "disarmed and powerless" in front of the problem of poverty.Waigel also warned against any delay in the planned 1999 launching of the Euro, saying that a delay would encourage EU countries to ease up on budgetary restraint and would almost certainly lead to a surge in the German mark's value that would threaten Germany's economic recovery, and its chances of reducing unemployment.It said that France's economic growth rate could attain 2.5 percent in 1997, and 2.6 percent in 1998, while its public deficit could drop to 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product  by the end of 1997.Back from a twoday European Union summit in Amsterdam, Waigel told reporters in Munich that due to the massive debt burden left over from the former East Germany, Bonn could run up a national debt slightly above the Euro benckmark of 60 percent of gross domestic product .
