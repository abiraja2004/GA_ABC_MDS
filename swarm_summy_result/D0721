No   manslaughter victim deserved to die,'' he said.On Monday, prosecutors called their first three witnesses: Aaron   Kreifels, the college student who found Shepard; Charles Dolan, the  neighbor who tried to help; and Albany County Deputy Reggie Fluty,  who said she told the barely breathing victim, ``Baby, I'm so sorry  this happened.''At Castro and Market streets, the Castro rainbow flag was lowered to halfstaff, and mourners left impromptu memorials.One of two men accused in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 22, goes   on trial Monday on charges of firstdegree murder, kidnapping and  aggravated robbery.His attorneys are trying to convince the jury McKinney is guilty   of manslaughter rather than murder.Reggie Fluty, an Albany County sheriff's deputy, testified on Thursday that Shepard's wrists had been so tightly bound that it had been difficult to cut the rope and that his head had been covered in blood except for a clean spot ``where he'd been crying and the tears went down his face.''In that respect, it echoes, Kaufman says, his bestknown work, ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' which had a long New York run, as well as a successful engagement at the Denver Center Theater last year..Rerucha said McKinney and Henderson drove Shepard, 21, to a   remote area, where they robbed him of $20, lashed him to the fence  and began pistolwhipping him.A judge today barred defense lawyers from   using a ``gay panic'' defense in the murder trial of a man accused  of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard.He was found by a bicyclist 18 hours later and taken to a hospital, where he lived only four more days.Most people who abhor homophobia are themselves Christian _ and so, for that matter, are most gay Americans.``At times, I don't think you are worthy of addressing,'' Mrs. Shepard said, turning to the man who had just pled guilty to murdering her son.
