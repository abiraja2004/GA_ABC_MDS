COL. 1 of WILLIAMS          So a lifestyle portal deal does make sense for WilliamsSonoma _ but the company decided to pursue just such an opportunity with a different set of partners, not Starbucks and Oxygen, last week.Starbucks has sold jazz CDs in its coffee shops for several years and considers music an important part of how customers experience its brand, said Bonnie Kramer Tonneson, an analyst with Hambrecht  Quist.It is a wellrun company with a bright future on the Web and a relatively low valuation, said industry analysts.By David Lazarus          STARBUCKS   _ Coffee giant Starbucks Corp. has purchased Hear Music, an upscale music retailer that until recently was based in San Francisco, for under $10 million.Starbucks, the Seattlebased coffee retailer, will also help hype Kozmo as it enters new markets.He becomes president of consumer products for Starbucks, and will report to Starbucks' president and chief operating officer, Orin Smith.Starbucks has installed a link from its home page, www.starbucks.com, to Hear Music's site, www.hearmusic.com.``We are going to have much, much more than a 5 percent share of the coffee market in America, I promise you.''The ingredients listing, for example,  says each tea bag includes ``the mumbled chantings of a certified  tea shaman.''Tonneson said.OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS: Johnson recently became Starbucks' first jointventure partner, with a location in Los Angeles.Scott Mowbray, the managing editor of Joe, said that his editorial goal was to replicate the ideas and the conversation one encounters in a coffeehouse.On Tuesday, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz stood before a happy house of shareholders in Seattle and touted the company's progress in bringing its coffeehouse culture to the rest of the planet.``I think I have a shot, I have more than a shot,'' said Bradley, once an allstar forward with the New York Knicks.Schultz told analysts and investors in a conference call late Wednesday that the company would create the ``premier lifestyle portal on the Internet,'' saying that the Starbucks Web site would offer ``a feeling of romance, of relaxation'' similar to what he said a customer might experience in a coffee shop.
