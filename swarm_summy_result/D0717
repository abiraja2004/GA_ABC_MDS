American Home Products agreed in October to pay $3.75 billion to settle claims that the diet drugs had been harmful.More than 4,000 lawsuits nationwide have been filed against the   company by people who say they suffer heart and lung problems  because of the pills.     PHILADELPHIA   Opponents of a proposed $3.75 billion national settlement of health claims against the diet drug combination fenphen called the deal inadequate Tuesday as a judge began hearing testimony on the fairness of the settlement.The Madison, N.J.based drug maker pulled fenfluramine and Redux   off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's  request after a Mayo Clinic study linked the drugs to potentially  fatal heart valve damage.Circuit Court of Appeals if the judge gives his approval.Since Pondimin, American Home Products' brand name for fenfluramine _ the ``fen'' in fenphen _ and Redux, a similar drug, were removed from the market in September 1997, 6,500 lawsuits covering 11,000 people have been filed.''The settlement is the result of a dedicated effort between plaintiffs' attorneys and American Home Products to create a comprehensive and equitable plan,'' said Louis L. Hoynes Jr., American Home's senior vice president and general counsel.Fenfluramine had been sold since the 1970s but became widely   used in the 1990s when doctors prescribed it for weight loss in  combination with another drug, phentermine.It sold the drug under the brand name Pondimin along with a chemical cousin called Redux.Other opponents say monetary damages are deficient, the settlement does not include compensation for people who may develop health problems later and users had inadequate representation.Debbie Stone Lovett also  alleged fenfluramine caused heart valve damage.
