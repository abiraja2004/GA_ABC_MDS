        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. American Home made the "fen" in fenphen, a drug called fenfluramine. A source who asked to remain anonymous said the Smith settlement was between $6 million and $7 million, and the three settlements were $7.5 million to $8 million. The company pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fenfluramine to potentially fatal heart valve damage. The  trial was the nation's first involving a patient who died after  taking the product. No jury has yet deliberated on a fenphen case, and the Smith case was the furthest any such case has progressed. About six  million people took the drug combination. More than 2,600 individual lawsuits have been filed against   fenphen, and classaction lawsuits asking the company to pay for  medical checkups and future medical treatments have been certified  in several states. When taken alone, phentermine never was  associated with health problems. Some plaintiffs' lawyers said Wednesday that after the Mississippi jury verdict, many fenphen sufferers would choose to pursue their claims in court.
