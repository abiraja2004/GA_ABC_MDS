The decision will be made at the bureau's meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December. A fourth uranium mine could be approved within a year after Energy Resources Australia  company moved to fasttrack for the Jabiluka mine in Kakadu National Park. Environment Minister Robert Hill said the government will cooperate with the investigation, but that it is unnecessary because ``there is no evidence that the world heritage values are at risk.'' The Australian:    The Australian government's environmental report on the Jabiluka uranium mine , to be released Thursday, found the area is not under threat and attacked a UNESCO report that said Kakadu Natural Park was in danger. Construction has begun at Jabiluka, where ERA has identified more than 90,000 metric tons of uranium oxide, making it one of the largest untapped highgrade uranium ore bodies in the world. The delegation will recommend whether to list Kakadu as the 26th ``in danger'' site of the 552 sites recognized by the United Nations' World Heritage Bureau for environmental and cultural values. Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles  of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125mile  sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species including many that are rare or endangered. It was unlikely the committee would disagree with the bureau. Antiuranium protesters distanced themselves from the Darwin attack. Environmental groups and the Mirrar Aborigines of the region claim it will cause environmental damage.
