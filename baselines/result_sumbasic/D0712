``This looks like its over,'' Rushdie said.     TEHRAN, Iran  _ An Iranian foundation has added dlrs 300,000 to the reward for Salman Rushdie's death, just weeks after the Iranian government tried to distance itself from the bounty. A ``fatwa,'' or religious edict, was issued by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against Rushdie in 1989 on grounds his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' was blasphemous. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati reiterated here last week that Iran would not send anyone to kill the author. Islamic militants put a 1.2 million pound  bounty on the Indianborn British writer's head. Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries. And hardliners staged two demonstrations in Tehran in support of the death sentence. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance came under heavy attacks in 1995 by the religious conservatives that took the ministry for allowing the publication of romantic novels. The official at presidential office said that Rafsanjani wanted to draw the attention to the religious importance of the decree. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who made the announcement in New York, and his British counterpart, Robin Cook, had portrayed the move as a way to improve ties that have remained strained over the issue and agreed to exchange ambassadors.
