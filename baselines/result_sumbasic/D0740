There will be Tony, there will be me, and there will be both of us together,'' he said. It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world. ``Our No. Balloon Team Flies Over Caribbean     GENEVA   A SwissEnglish balloon team was about 300 miles   from Jamaica late Wednesday night. Pilots Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of   Switzerland have flown further than any balloonist before,  traveling more than 21,625 miles after leaving the Swiss Alps on  March 1. Early   Friday, they beat the endurance record set two weeks ago by two  British balloonists who later ditched in bad weather near Japan. Uliassi has permission to fly over China, which he is expected to do in the next several days before heading out over the Pacific. This will be the last flight sponsored by Swiss watchmaker Breitling, he added. The pair completed their circumnavigation on Saturday, crossing an invisible line in the air far above Mauritania. Despite concerns about communications and fuel consumption,   Smith said the pilots were confident they would make it to North  Africa and complete the trip.
