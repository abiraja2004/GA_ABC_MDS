Napster, he said, had ``hijacked'' his music. But it's not everybody's right. Inside: the names of 300,000 people the band Metallica wanted booted from the service for copyright infringement. Napster also has been sued by the Recording Industry Association of America in federal court in San Francisco. Napster allows Internet users to store their music on the site and to download their own tunes _ for nothing. Other likely opponents are telecommunications companies and Internet companies that worked for years to reach the compromise that was passed into law. When users download songs onto either their hard drive or a CD, they get the song, but the artist doesn't get any money. A spokesman for Indiana University said lawyers for the university had not seen the lawsuit. The ruling is likely to disappoint millions of Napster fans who use the Internet program to trade free music with each other. The same idea could be used to swap electronic books and computer software.
