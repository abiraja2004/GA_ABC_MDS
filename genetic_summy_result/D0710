``We do hope that this cloud which appeared this last weekend will leave us and we will continue our good relations,'' Tzur said    The Justice Ministry said Sunday evening that the men have not been linked to Israel's government, but an investigation continues.
Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis were spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
The appearance of the two Israelis in court came two days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement that was interpreted by the Israeli media as a confirmation the two worked for Israel's Mossad.
The two Israelis were arrested near a military camp in southern Cyprus last November at a time when Cyprus was to deploy a battery of Russian S-300 missiles in the region.
He speculated that the two might have been hired by a private Turkish outfit.
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides reaffirmed Saturday that his government would go ahead and deploy the anti-aircraft missiles.
 A senior official in Israel's Mossad intelligence agency has reportedly resigned following the arrest of two agents in Cyprus _ the third botched spy mission in a year.
Senior intelligence sources told the Maariv newspaper that the Mossad would not take such risks to gather intelligence on Turkey's behalf.
The Israelis arrested at the village of Zigi were found to have   radio scanners, a laptop computer, cellular phones and eight maps  of the island.
The spying charge states that the two men collected information linked to the defense of Cyprus and transmitted this to a ``foreign state'' through a computer between Oct. 15 and Nov. 6.
Israel TV said the two men arrived three weeks ago during a military training exercise in the area.
Spying charges pressed against the two Israelis were dropped by the prosecution for lack of evidence.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman had almost succeeded in patching up relations with Cyprus with a three-day visit to the island last week.
