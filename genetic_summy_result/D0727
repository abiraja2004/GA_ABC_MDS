 The estranged wife of former U.S. House speaker Newt Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga., judge to freeze the couple's assets until their divorce is final.
Last month, Hedge ordered lawyers for the Gingriches to try to reach a compromise on the subpoena.
Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney, filed a motion Wednesday in   Cobb County Superior Court asking that Marianne Gingrich be forced  to transfer the money to a joint account within 14 days.
The contentious divorce has been full of unusual turns, including Gingrich's deposition Tuesday in Virginia of Bisek, who admitted the two have carried on a six-year affair.
The subpoena to Ms. Bisek requests documents and other items   dating from January 1995, when Gingrich became speaker.
In fact, the deposition will be taken at her attorney's office in Washington, according to Tuesday's filing.
Thursday also brought the public release of a Sept. 10 temporary agreement the Gingriches signed splitting and securing their assets while they litigate their divorce.
Mayoue has said he intends to question Bisek about all aspects of her relationship with Newt Gingrich.
Newt Gingrich's divorce moves to a courtroom for the first time today as lawyers argue whether 32 questions is really just 32 questions.
Gingrich, 56, resigned as speaker just over a year ago, after severe losses in the November 1998 elections.

Last week, Gingrich left his office twice to walk the Mall, once with a close aide and once with his wife, Marianne.
Gingrich also is asking that Marianne Gingrich be ordered to account for all the couple's cash and stocks.
But Marianne Gingrich says she and her husband were living together in a Marietta, Ga., condo.
Divorce attorneys watching the case predicted early on that Gingrich would settle the case, rather than allow his personal life to be examined in a public trial.
