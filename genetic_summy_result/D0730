In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress.
Clinton became the first president to use the power by vetoing a series of small items last August, exercising the veto power 82 times last year, striking 1.9 billion dollars in spending projected over five years.
Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
 that the line item veto disrupts the balance of powers between the legislative and executive branch.
Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws, eliminating 82 items, including money for New York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who is a former Arizona state lawmaker, dissented, along with Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer.
Instead the court found that the line-item veto violates the ```presentment clause'' of Article I.
But, he said, if Congress wants to establish such procedures, it must amend the federal Constitution.
Kennedy said that the device ``compromises the political liberty of our citizens'' by concentrating power in the hands of the president.
Congress, in adopting the legislation, tried to get around the ``Presentment Clause'' by saying the president actually signed bills into law and, then, separately, went back and canceled specific budget and tax items.
 The Justice Department is planning to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court after a federal judge struck down the line-item veto Thursday as unconstitutional.
The Line-Item Veto Act was passed as part of the Republicans' Contract With America.
