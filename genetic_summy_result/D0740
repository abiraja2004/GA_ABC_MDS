Their new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon will take off from Chateau d'Oex, in the Swiss Alps, as soon after Nov. 25 as weather conditions are favorable, they said.
If the team makes it to North Africa, it will have traveled more   than 26,000 miles around the world and Piccard and Jones will have  conquered one of the last great challenges facing aviators.
The first two, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of Britain, completed a 20-day trip together last March, ending in the Egyptian desert.
 A Swiss-English balloon team soared over   Mexico early today after completing a six-day journey across the  Pacific Ocean in an attempt to become the first balloonists to  travel nonstop around the world.
The three ditched their balloon off Hawaii in December  after flying 13,751 miles, more than halfway around the globe.
The crash between the tractor-trailer and Amtrak's  City of New Orleans killed 11 people Monday night in the nation's  deadliest train wreck in three years.
Thereafter, the capsule and most of the balloon will be presented to the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum.
 The Swiss and British balloonists aiming to be the   first to circle the world nonstop floated over the Pacific Ocean  Thursday after making it across China, their Geneva control center  said.
The team will try to pick up a stream over the eastern Caribbean   by Friday and then head for North Africa.
But the team spokeswoman in Geneva, Monika Pieren, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that if wind directions and speeds correspond to the meteorological forecasts, the balloon would have enough propane to safely reach Mauritania and the goal line before fuel runs out.
From there, they hope to ride jetstreams that should move them along in an east-bound direction at around 200 kilometers an hour at 10,000 meters.
A spokesman said the two pilots saw little of China because of   clouds below them as they crossed inside the zone agreed by the  Chinese government.
