Russia signed a contract with Iran in 1995 to complete the construction of the Bushehr nuclear plant in southern Iran, defying pressures of the United States, which has repeatedly attempted to convince Russia not to cooperate on the project.
 Iran will not build an atomic bomb despite nuclear tests by Pakistan and India that have forced ``a new security situation'' on the country, the defense minister said in comments published Monday.
Iran has long sought to launch a medium-range missile, and has bought technology from Russian and China as well as North Korea.
At the same time, Moscow and Tehran confirmed the inalienable right of all countries to acquire and develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes.
U.S. officials repeatedly accused Tehran of seeking access to technology to produce nuclear weapons through building nuclear power plants.
In the communique, the two countries acknowledged that the proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction constituted threat to international peace and security.

As recently as last year, intelligence officials were telling congressional intelligence panels that Iran might be able to test a missile that could reach targets in the United States by 2010.
