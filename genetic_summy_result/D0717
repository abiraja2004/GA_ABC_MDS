 A judge dismissed the jury in a   class-action lawsuit against one of the makers of the fen-phen diet  drug combination, raising expections of a possible out-of-court  settlement.
The Madison, N.J.-based company sold the combination under the brand name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a chemical cousin.
American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market   in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request.
 American Home Products Corp. has reportedly paid   more than $3 million to settle a lawsuit by a 70-year-old woman  that linked her rare lung disease to the diet-drug combination  fen-phen.
Several are class-action suits  asking the company to pay for medical checkups and future  treatments for people who don't know whether they have problems.
The plaintiff, Sandra Moore of Johnson  County, claimed that fenfluramine caused her heart valve damage.
Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as  leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an  often-fatal lung disease.
 In a major step toward resolving health claims against the diet drug combination fen-phen, drug maker American Home Products said just 1 percent of the drug's users have opted out of a multibillion dollar settlement.
``By  the time she took it, they knew of 35 cases of valvular heart  disease, but had not warned doctors about any of them.''
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated   with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
The Mayo Clinic had collected information from patients who had developed heart valve damage after taking the drugs.
Petroff said a national settlement with AHP is being discussed   but that it is in preliminary stages and could take months.
In October 1999, American Home agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to fen-phen.
