In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga., Barton   acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the  Alabama killings.
 Long considered the only suspect in the   hacking deaths of his wife and mother-in-law in northeast Alabama,  Mark Barton once made a chilling claim to an investigator in the  case.
``We didn't have any witnesses who could put him there,'' said   Smith, an investigator with the Cherokee County district attorney's  office.
Barton shot and killed nine people in two Atlanta stock-trading   offices on Thursday, injuring 13 others.
Investigators believe Barton, involved with another woman, came   to Alabama to ask her for a divorce and she refused, prompting the  killings.
I need help,'' he told Leigh Ann Barton, one of the 12 people he would kill in July in a bloody rampage that spanned three days and about 30 miles, from Stockbridge to the office suites of Buckhead, ending in his suicide at a BP service station in Acworth.
Police always believed Barton was to blame for the grisly   slayings of his first wife, Debra Barton, and her mother, Eloise  Spivey, in 1993.
Early tests on Barton's company car indicated the possible   presence of blood around the front seat.
Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with   $150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the  remainder going to Barton and his lawyers.
``We have 27 years of wonderful memories of her life and only a few hours of shocking memories of her death,'' Davis said.
Nell Jones, 53, a day trader at All-Tech, said she was sitting   at her computer when she heard shots.
Inside the apartment were the bodies of Barton's children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Michelle, and their stepmother, Leigh Ann Barton.
Using a hammer ``just seemed like a quiet way to kill and a   relatively painless way to die,'' he wrote.
He got mad at me one time because he   couldn't convince me he didn't do it,'' Smith said.
