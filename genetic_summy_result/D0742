This type of disorientation is one of the leading causes of fatal aircraft accidents, according to a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration report.
NTSB officials released more information Monday from additional radar data received from a Nantucket airport that showed Kennedy's plane dropped 1,100 feet in only 14 seconds on that hazy Friday night as the plane flew about four miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard on its final approach to the island's airport.
``That airplane would not come down that fast in any normal configuration,'' said Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
 A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard.
The president called several members of the Kennedy family, including Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy; his uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
``He came within 17 miles west of Martha's Vineyard, and then in the last few minutes he seemed to descend rather steeply for that airplane.
Another New Jersey flight instructor flew with Kennedy in several airplanes for 39 hours, including 21 at night, and nearly an hour in instrument conditions.
Federal investigators cautioned Sunday that the search could take months and that the cause of the crash might never be determined.
But Kennedy responded that he ``wanted to do it alone,'' the instructor told the National Transportation Safety Board.
A. Kennedy took off from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. at 8:38 p.m. Friday night, flying a Piper Saratoga single-engine plane.
 Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law, NBC News reported Thursday.
