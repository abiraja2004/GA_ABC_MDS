Napster is also fighting copyright infringement suits filed by rap artists Dr. Dre and the Recording Industry Association of America trade group.
Metallica, which last month filed a civil suit to stop the San Mateo, Calif., startup, wants Napster to block further access to all of the users on the 60,000-page list, a request Napster says it might honor.
Napster created software that allows people to share and swap MP3-formatted songs over the Internet without paying for the music.
The Metallica suit originally named three colleges, the University of Southern California, Yale University and Indiana University, that the band said were allowing use of Napster by their students.
Napster spokesman Dan Wool said the company would accept Ulrich's list and review it to determine if any users needed to be booted off the service.
Napster officials assert they are not involved in music piracy because the music is not kept on the company's computers.
 The lawyer representing Metallica and Dr. Dre in lawsuits against Napster Inc. has asked Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and more than two-dozen other colleges to ``promptly ban'' the popular file sharing program.
Ulrich said that ``if music is free for downloading, the music industry is not viable.''
A lawyer for the band said the users, identified by their online handles, were making Metallica recordings available for others to copy.
Napster chief executive Hank Barry countered that the Web site's 20 million users have a right to ``share'' music under copyright law.
''The fact that so many people have come forward and disputed Metallica's accusation that they did not break the law demonstrates that this is not a black and white issue,'' Napster's 19-year-old founder Shawn Fanning said in a statement.
On Napster's Web site, one fan wrote that the name of one of the band's CDs, Master of Puppets, perfectly epitomized the metal group.
