 A high-level United Nations delegation on Monday began touring Australia's Kakadu National Park to examine claims a uranium mine being built in the region threatens unique cultural and environmental values.
Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles  of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile  sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered.
The Jabiluka mine, which is expected to dig up almost 20 million metric tons of uranium ore in 28 years, is supported by the current conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard.
Brown said he would write to the bureau to say millions of Australians, international experts and the local Aboriginal people did not agree with its decision.
The team will report to a meeting of the bureau in Kyoto, Japan, in December where it will recommend whether to place the park on a list of endangered world heritage sites.
 Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory.
The owners of the Jabiluka lease oppose the mine, claiming it will cause environmental and indirect cultural damage.
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill said scientific evidence proved the natural values of Kakadu would not be threatened by the development of the mine.
Philip Shirvington, ERA's chief executive, has said independent scientific studies have found no adverse impact on the environment from uranium mining at Ranger.
She urged the U.N. group to put Kakadu on the list of world heritage areas considered to be in danger.
The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
The government-approved  mine site is in an area surrounded by Aboriginal-owned Kakadu  National Park.
